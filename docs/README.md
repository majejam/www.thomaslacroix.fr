- [Jest](http://jestjs.io/) with [vue-test-utils](https://vue-test-utils.vuejs.org/)

You can find documentation and informations about each modules by following the above links.

## Usage

We recommend using Yarn but you can also use NPM.

There is only 3 commands that you can either run using `npm run` or `yarn`:

- `start` to launch a developpement server with hot reload.
- `build` to create a production version in `/dist`.
- `serve` to launch a web server in `/dist`.

## Configuration

Application configuration is located in `src/config.js`.

Build can be configured in `webpack.config.js`, like the dev server host and port.

```js
serve: {
  host: "localhost",
  port: 3000
}
```

SASS Linter can be configured in `.sass-lint.yml`.

ESLint can be configured in `.eslintrc.js`.

## Routing

Routes are listed in `src/router/index.js` and should contain a meta node with a title, it will be displayed as the document.title, concatened with the separator and the site name in application config.

```js
{
  "path": "/",
  "name": "Home",
  "component": Index,
  "meta": {
    "title": "Accueil"
  }
}
```

## Generator

I created a generator using Yeoman, it can generate view, styles and tests. You can find it [here](https://github.com/QRaimbault/generator-qraimbault-vuejs) with installation and usage instructions.

## API

API use Axios and the base configuration is set in application configuration file.

```js
export const APIConfig = {
  baseURL: "",
  withCredentials: true,
  crossDomain: true,
  contentType: false,
  responseType: "json",
  headers: {
    Accept: "application/json",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  }
};
```

Axios configuration reference is available [here](https://github.com/axios/axios#request-config).

The Axios instance is then generated and exported in `src/helpers/API.js` and you can import it in your views/components this way:

```js
import api from "@API";
```

## Vuex

The Vuex store is located in `src/vuex`.

There is a main config file (`src/vuex/store.js`) and a `modules` directories.

If your application is simple, you can put your state, getters, mutators and actions directly in the store. If it is more complexe, create one sub-directory in `modules` by functionnality and import in in the store.

The store is accessible from any component/view using `this.$store`.

## Style

All you view/component specific styles should be placed in a file named exactly like the component, in the same directory.  
You can place project-specific style in `src/scss` and import it from the component specific styles (see example in `src/components/Index).

You should import styles in the `<script>` tag in each component.

You can also put style in the `<style>` tag in each component, scoped or not, the style injection works the same way using scss files or `<style>` tag.

## Assets

### Imported assets

Assets (images, fonts...) used directly in views (Like logo... etc) should be placed in src/assets (`@Asset`) and imported like a JavaScript module and used like a variable. Example:

```js
import logo from "@/images/logo.png";
```

You can also import it in scss using webpack resolved path or relative path as usual. Example:

```scss
.bg-image {
  background-image: url('@Asset/images/background.png');
}
// OR
.bg-image {
  background-image: url('../../assets/images/background.png');
}
```

### Static assets

Assets used directyle in `static/index.html` like favicon for example should be placed in `static/assets` and will be copied on build in the `dist/assets` directory.

## Single file components

This starter uses [Single File Components](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/single-file-components.html) structure, which is more suitable for large project but doesn't make it harder for small apps.

### Views

Views are located in `src/views` and should have their unique styles. It can be compared to a "page". The routes are pointing to views and not to components. They can include one or more components or even none.

### Components

Components are located in `src/components` and should have their unique styles. Components must be imported and used in views. They should be separated in sub-directories organized by views or by functionnalities.

## Webpack Aliases

Webpack allows to put some aliases in the webpack config, so you can have shorter and more friendly import statements in your components/views. By default, this starter comes with some aliases listed bellow:

- `@API` pointing to `src/helpers/API.js`, so directly to the configured Axios instance
- `@Config` pointing to `src/config.js`
- `@Component` pointing to `src/components`
- `@View` pointing to `src/views`
- `@MasterStyle` pointing to `src/scss/master.scss`
- `@Asset` pointing to `src/assets`
- `@Test` pointing to `__test__`
- `@` pointing to `src`

An example usage of these aliases is to get the API helper from a view/component:

```js
import api from "@API";
```

Or to get a component from a view:

```js
import Articles from "@Component/Index/Articles.vue";
```

## Unit Testing

Unit testing is handled using Jest, you can find an example in `src/components/Index/Articles.spec.js`. They are run in the CI build system, using Travis-CI.

You can place your stubs/mocks in `__test__` (`@Test`) directory when they are project-wide tests assets.
